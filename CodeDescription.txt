Data Visualization
Figure 1:
	Shows the daily percentage change of the Index (Index_Change_Percent) over time
	Gray Line:
		Represents the daily return (percentage change) of the financial index
	Red Dashed Line: This is the Crash Threshold:
		(CRASH_THRESHOLD_DAILY = -5.0%). Any daily drop that touches or crosses
		this line if defined as a "crash"
	Large Red Dots: 
		These dots specifically highlight the days where the daily return was less than or equal to the -5.0 threshold
	
Figure 2:
	Second plot is a model performance diagnostic. Tells you how well your neural network
	(the LSTM) is learning from the data during the training process
	Shows: 
		How the model's error (loss) changes over each training epoch (full pass through the training data)
	Blue Line (Training loss):
		Represents the error measured on the data the model is activley learning from (training set).
		Will decrease steadily.
	Orange Line (Val Loss):
		Represents the error measured on a small, reserved subset of the training data (the validation set).
		The model has not seen this data before.
			In an ideal scenario:
				Both lines decrease and flatten out close to each other
			Overfitting:
				If the blue line keeps droppping but the orange line starts increasing,
				it means the model is memorizing the training data instead of learning general rules, which is called overfitting
			Early Stopping: 
				Model uses 'Early Stopping' callback, meaning the training stops automatically if the validation loss
				for not improve for 5 epoch (patience = 5) ensuring the model doesn't overfitting
	If the lines look smooth and decreating, the model is training correctly and efficiently. If not, adjustments to me made
	
Optimal Prediction Threshold:
	Crash events are rare, 10% might be considered a high warning. So searching for a balance between catching crashes. False alarms = 'F1-score'
	Example:
		If it says 'Optimal Prediction Threshold: 0.1500' the model considers any prediction above 
		15% to be a "crash warning"
Classification Report:
	Recall in Class 1:
		Out of all the future crashes that actually happened, how many did it predict?
		A high recall (0.85) means the model is good at giving warnings for real danger.
	Precision for Class 1:
		Out of all the times the model predicted a crash, how many times was it correct. 
		Low precision means too many false alarms\
Top 10 Highest predicted crash probabilities:
	This is the real-world output. Shows dates where the model had the highest confidence (PredCrashProb)
	that a crash would occur within the next 10 days (CRASH_HORIZON).
	This is what you would use to make a decision to reduce risk.
Final Output:
	Most valuable output is the table showing the highest predicted crash probabilites
		This table gives the dates where the market is currently exhibiting the strongest historical patterns that lean to a crash
		By looking at the highest scores, any user can quickly see when the risk level is dangerously high, 
		allowing for proactive derisking actions within 10 day window
