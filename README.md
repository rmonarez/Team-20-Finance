# Team-20-Finance
ENG220 Finance Final Project
Project Proposal Plan
Project Abstract
  Our project topic is “Finance” which we have decided to further narrow down to stock
  market predictors. Upon further research into the topic and looking at different data sets,
  we noticed one of the most dramatic displays of ups and downs visible graphically for
  collapses and recoveries. The problem to be solved we’ve identified is “How can we predict
  (and possibly prevent) future market collapses?” Our motivation in approaching this is the
  current state of the US economy. We are very much entering a recession which most of us
  are feeling the effects of, and which has a direct correlation to the stock market. Our ideal
  outcome for this project is to at least be able to create some sort of AI predictive model to
  analyze market patterns. Our chosen data set covers the historical time-series use of data to
  then be able to predict which markets will either succeed or fail. This will help us create our
  own predicative model.
